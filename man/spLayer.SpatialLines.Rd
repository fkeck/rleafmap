\arguments{
\item{x}{a spatial object (see Details).}

\item{name}{a character string to name the layer.}

\item{stroke}{logical. Should a stroke be drawn along lines and polygons?}

\item{stroke.col}{a vector of any of the three kinds of \R color specifications to set strokes color.}

\item{stroke.lwd}{a numerical vector to set strokes width.}

\item{stroke.lty}{a character vector that defines the strokes dash patterns (See Details).}

\item{stroke.alpha}{a vector of numeric values in \eqn{[0, 1]} setting strokes opacity.}

\item{label}{a reserved argument (in development).}

\item{popup}{a character vector giving contents for popups. HTML tags are accepted.}

\item{popup.rmd}{a logical indicating whether the popups should be processed as R Markdown with \pkg{knitr}. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{legend}{a legend object created with \code{\link{layerLegend}}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to the function.}
